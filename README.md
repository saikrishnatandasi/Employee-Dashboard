- Weekly breakdown with attendance rates

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Days**: 775
- **Total Working Days**: 500
- **Attendance**: 439 days
- **Present %**: 87.8%
- **Remote %**: 16.8%
- **Overall Attendance**: 88% (January)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Power Query Editor**: Used unpivot operations to transform raw attendance data
- **Data Structure**: Employee status data unpivoted by date for flexible analysis
- **Data Modeling**: Optimized relationships for efficient calculation

### SVG Integration
- **DAX Measures**: Custom measures that return SVG code as strings
- **Matrix Visual**: Leveraged Power BI's matrix table to display SVG content
- **Dynamic Rendering**: SVG elements change based on data values and conditions




## üé® What is SVG?

**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** is an XML-based vector image format that offers several advantages for data visualization:

- **Scalability**: Perfect rendering at any size without pixelation
- **Customization**: Full control over styling, colors, and animations
- **Interactivity**: Support for hover effects and click events
- **Performance**: Lightweight and fast-loading
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible with proper markup
